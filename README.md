# Upsy-Downsy

Entry for LowRezJam 2024: https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2024
Theme "You Are The Environment".

Also a trial of my new and incomplete platform Pebble: https://github.com/aksommerville/pebble

Help the rabbit reach his carrot by raising or lowering columns of earth.

## Notes

Try a 10x10 grid of 6x6-pixel tiles, leaves us 4 pixels for a status bar.

## TODO

- [ ] Final scenes. Finish by 9 August.
- - [ ] 1: Make a bunch, like at least 30. ...30 is a lot. Got 16 so far.
- - [ ] 2: Sort by difficulty.
- - [ ] 3: Eliminate ones too similar to others, or that I don't like after playing.
- - [ ] 4: Repack IDs.
- [x] Calibrate scorekeeping, ensure 10k is not reachable.
- - [x] Continuous scale for time.
- - +20 for scene completion.
- - +30 for no deaths in scene.
- - +100..200 or 0 per clock.
- - Yields <=250 per scene, so a hard limit of 40 scenes keeps us under 10000 points.
- [ ] Decoration and verbiage for Itch page.

## Target time

First a quick playthrough, at my best:
GAME: scene:1 4.128616
GAME: scene:2 8.241430
GAME: scene:3 6.481806
GAME: scene:4 9.121358
GAME: scene:5 9.223393
GAME: scene:6 12.117926
GAME: scene:7 6.838207
GAME: scene:8 10.085229
GAME: scene:9 10.291253
GAME: scene:10 11.947672
GAME: scene:11 5.803320
GAME: scene:12 16.563150
GAME: scene:13 9.699845
GAME: scene:14 3.620619
GAME: scene:15 14.635120
GAME: scene:16 11.085756
GAME: scene:17 8.633356
GAME: scene:18 19.205777
GAME: scene:19 9.117646

And confirm I now get the bonus every time, unless i fuck up.
Looks good. Did fuck up 5 and 14, missed the bonus.
Final score 3205.
Time bonuses were mostly <150, a few higher.
