# Upsy-Downsy

Entry for LowRezJam 2024: https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2024
Theme "You Are The Environment".

Also a trial of my new and incomplete platform Pebble: https://github.com/aksommerville/pebble

Help the rabbit reach his carrot by raising or lowering columns of earth.

## Notes

Try a 10x10 grid of 6x6-pixel tiles, leaves us 4 pixels for a status bar.

## TODO

- [ ] Final scenes.
- [ ] Decoration and verbiage for Itch page.
- [x] Persistence isn't working on itch. Arrange a local server and test.
- - Forgot, you need "version" or "persistKey" to make that work in web.
