# Upsy-Downsy

Entry for LowRezJam 2024: https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2024
Theme "You Are The Environment".

Also a trial of my new and incomplete platform Pebble: https://github.com/aksommerville/pebble

Help the rabbit reach his carrot by raising or lowering columns of earth.

## Notes

Try a 10x10 grid of 6x6-pixel tiles, leaves us 4 pixels for a status bar.

## TODO

- ASAP:
- [ ] Platforms.
- [x] Hammer.
- [ ] Water.
- [x] Crocodile. Moves just like the rabbit, keep them apart.
- [ ] Hawk. Eats rabbit if he stands still.
- [ ] Static horizontal flamethrower.
- After game logic stable:
- [ ] Sound effects.
- [ ] Refine background music. Currently all one wave, and probly we should fine-tune the Off times.
- [ ] Final scenes.
- [ ] Proper content for status bar.
- [ ] Scorekeeping.
- [ ] Decoration and verbiage for Itch page.
