# Upsy-Downsy

Entry for LowRezJam 2024: https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2024
Theme "You Are The Environment".

Also a trial of my new and incomplete platform Pebble: https://github.com/aksommerville/pebble
You'll have to clone and build that first, if you want to build Upsy-Downsy from source.

Help the rabbit reach his carrot by raising or lowering columns of earth.

## TODO
