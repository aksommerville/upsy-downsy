# Upsy-Downsy

Entry for LowRezJam 2024: https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2024
Theme "You Are The Environment".

Help the rabbit reach his carrot by raising or lowering columns of earth.

2025-12-15: Replatforming from Pebble to Egg.
You'll need to install [Egg v2](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) before building.

I'm leaving Egg's universal menu on.
It's fine for native builds, but on the web it will violate LowRexJam's 64x64-framebuffer rule.
The jam is over so whatever.
