# Upsy-Downsy

Entry for LowRezJam 2024: https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2024
Theme "You Are The Environment".

Also a trial of my new and incomplete platform Pebble: https://github.com/aksommerville/pebble

Help the rabbit reach his carrot by raising or lowering columns of earth.

## Notes

Try a 10x10 grid of 6x6-pixel tiles, leaves us 4 pixels for a status bar.

## TODO

- [ ] Final scenes. Finish by 9 August.
- - [ ] 1: Make a bunch, like at least 30. ...30 is a lot. Got 16 so far.
- - [ ] 2: Sort by difficulty.
- - [ ] 3: Eliminate ones too similar to others, or that I don't like after playing.
- - [ ] 4: Repack IDs.
- [ ] Calibrate scorekeeping, ensure 10k is not reachable.
- [x] Revisit margins, I've only made them worse. ...back to black. Maybe change the itch page to match.
- [x] Try a cheerier color scheme. ...only background color, seems really to make a difference.
- [ ] Decoration and verbiage for Itch page.
